          <ContextDescription>
            Pickrr provides services to thousands of sellers with N number of
            features throughout the dashboard. From shipping, tracking and
            packing products to counter the negative occurrences such as weight
            disputes, order returns and non deliverables. The seller uses Pickrr
            dashboard to ship his products and Pickrr uses various courier
            partners to make the shipment.

          <ContextTitle>Problem statement</ContextTitle>
          <StoryText>
            The customer receives all the updates of their orders by using
            tracking numbers provided by courier/Pickrr. The real time
            notifications for the customers was not possible. Pickrr dashboard
            had no feature to provide the realtime notifications to the sellerâ€™s
            customer which also had a cost associated with it.
          </StoryText>
          <ContextTitle>Solution</ContextTitle>
          <StoryText>
            Create a tool within the Pickrr dashboard that allows sellers to
            manage notifications and update the customers with the realtime
            status of the shipment. This would help the seller to keep the
            history of events at a single place and manage all the orders using
            the tool.

              Pain Points :
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Keeping track of all the orders at a single place was not
                  possible.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Customers would keep calling/email for the order status, hence
                  increasing costs for the company
                </li>

          <StoryText>
            We started to integrate the tool with the current dashboard. The
            necessary events and everything associated with the notifications
            module has to be in the proper hierarchy.

              UX Problem: The information that user needs to see is available on
              scroll while we search for a particular order. The search bar
              would remain on the top and take space which in turn makes user to
              scroll the page.
